# Heart Disease Prediction System

A machine learning–based project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in a patient using medical attributes. This project aims to assist early diagnosis and decision-making in healthcare.

---

## Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction can significantly improve treatment outcomes.  
This project uses supervised machine learning algorithms to analyze patient health data and predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease.
